# LunaHouseholdSecretsEngine

This sets up connectivity with the secrets engine.

This exposes a data structure with temporary credentials stored in the LunaHousehold Bitwarden account.

This uses the environment variables `BW_EMAIL`, `BW_PASSWORD`, `BW_CLIENTID`, `BW_CLIENTSECRET` (or other appropriate credentials) to define connectivity for the provider.
